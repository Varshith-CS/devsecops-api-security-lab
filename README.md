# DevSecOps API Security Lab

## Secure API Development, Security Testing, Remediation & Validation

This project demonstrates a complete DevSecOps workflow by building, testing, securing, and validating a vulnerable containerized API.

The project begins with intentionally insecure API endpoints and progresses through vulnerability discovery, automated security scanning, remediation, validation, and security automation using industry-standard DevSecOps tools.

## Technologies Used

### Application & Infrastructure

* Python
* Flask
* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Nginx

### Security Tools

* Bandit
* pip-audit
* GitLeaks
* Trivy
* OWASP ZAP

### DevSecOps

* GitHub Actions
* Secure SDLC
* Security Automation
* CI/CD Security Controls

---

## Project Objectives

* Build an intentionally vulnerable API
* Identify security weaknesses using automated security tools
* Remediate discovered vulnerabilities
* Validate fixes through re-testing
* Implement DevSecOps security automation
* Demonstrate Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) practices

---

## Initial Vulnerabilities

### Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)

Users could access other user records without authorization.

**Example**

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/2
```

---

### Broken Function Level Authorization

Administrative endpoints were accessible without proper authorization.

**Example**

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
```

---

### Sensitive Data Exposure

Application secrets and user information were exposed through insecure endpoints.

---

### Hardcoded Secrets

JWT secrets and API keys were stored directly in source code.

---

### Missing Security Headers

The application lacked common HTTP security protections.

---

## Security Assessment

### Bandit (SAST)

Identified:

* Hardcoded secrets
* Debug mode enabled
* Insecure runtime configuration

---

### pip-audit

Identified:

* Flask vulnerabilities
* PyJWT vulnerabilities
* Werkzeug vulnerabilities

---

### Trivy

Identified:

* Python package vulnerabilities
* Container OS vulnerabilities

---

### OWASP ZAP

Identified:

* Missing security headers
* Content Security Policy weaknesses
* Server information disclosure

---

## Remediation Activities

### Authentication & Authorization

Implemented:

* JWT Authentication
* Authorization middleware
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

---

### Secret Management

Removed hardcoded secrets from source code and migrated them to:

```text
.env
```

using:

```python
python-dotenv
```

---

### Password Security

Implemented password hashing using:

```python
werkzeug.security
```

---

### Security Headers

Implemented:

* Content-Security-Policy
* X-Content-Type-Options
* X-Frame-Options
* Referrer-Policy

---

### Reverse Proxy Security

Implemented Nginx reverse proxy to:

* Hide application framework details
* Centralize security headers
* Improve production readiness

---

### Dependency Remediation

Upgraded vulnerable packages:

* Flask
* PyJWT
* Werkzeug

---

## Security Validation Results

| Security Control             | Before   | After    |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Bandit Findings              | 6        | 0        |
| pip-audit Vulnerabilities    | 9        | 0        |
| Trivy Python Vulnerabilities | 8        | 0        |
| ZAP Header Findings          | Multiple | Reduced  |
| Debug Endpoint               | Exposed  | Removed  |
| BOLA Vulnerability           | Present  | Fixed    |
| Admin Authorization          | Missing  | Enforced |
| Hardcoded Secrets            | Present  | Removed  |

## GitHub Actions Security Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline automatically performs:

1. Bandit SAST Scan
2. pip-audit Dependency Scan
3. GitLeaks Secret Scan
4. Docker Image Build
5. Trivy Container Scan

Pipeline Location:

```text
.github/workflows/security-pipeline.yml
```

---

## Security Improvements Implemented

* Debug endpoint removed
* BOLA vulnerability remediated
* Admin authorization enforced
* Password hashing implemented
* Secrets moved to environment variables
* Dependency vulnerabilities remediated
* Security headers implemented
* Nginx reverse proxy deployed
* Security scanning automated through GitHub Actions
